// Which paragraphs a tracked revision removes from the laid-out document.
//
// A `w:del` on the paragraph MARK (17.13.5.15, `w:pPr/w:rPr/w:del`) says the mark itself was
// deleted, which in Word joins the paragraph to the one after it. When everything the
// paragraph would have rendered is deleted too, that join leaves nothing at all — Word shows
// no line where the paragraph was.
//
// Layout does not render deleted run content (a `w:del` is not a run container it walks, and
// `w:delText` is not model text), so such a paragraph reaches pagination with no spans and
// still claims a full line box. A cell of them is a stack of blank lines that pushes real
// content down the page and off it. This module identifies exactly that case.
//
// The narrow condition matters. A paragraph whose CONTENT is deleted but whose mark survives
// is a paragraph Word still shows as empty, and suppressing it would delete a blank line the
// document really has. A paragraph whose mark is deleted but which still renders something
// has to keep its box, because that content is visible and Word merely merges it forward —
// dropping it would lose text. Only the intersection is removed.
