// Typing AS A TRACKED CHANGE — what suggesting mode writes — and the node builders, wrapper
// merging and adjacency rules that striking text (`tree-op-tracked-delete.ts`) shares.
//
// Two shapes, and they are not symmetrical. An insertion is new content, so it goes into a
// `w:ins` wrapper the file did not have; a deletion keeps the words exactly where they are
// and re-labels them, `w:t` becoming `w:delText` inside a `w:del`. That asymmetry is the
// whole point of tracking: the reader has to be able to see what would go.
//
// WHY THE PARAGRAPH IS REBUILT rather than surgically patched. `w:ins` and `w:del` are
// paragraph-level (`EG_PContent`), not run-level, so tracking a change in the middle of a run
// means splitting that run and placing a sibling between the halves — and the run may sit
// inside a hyperlink, inside another revision, or both. A single ordered rebuild handles
// every nesting the same way; a set of splice-in-place edits needs a separate case for each
// and gets the offsets wrong the first time two of them overlap.
//
// Word's merge rules are followed where they are observable in the file:
//   - typing inside your own `w:ins` EXTENDS it rather than nesting a second one;
//   - deleting your own pending insertion REMOVES it, because there is nothing to propose to
//     anyone else — the text never existed for them;
//   - deleting inside an existing `w:del` does nothing, since it is already gone.
