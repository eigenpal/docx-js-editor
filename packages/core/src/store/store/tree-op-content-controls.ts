// Writing content controls: values, metadata, insertion, removal — and the locks that refuse.
//
// EVERY refusal in this module is a STORE refusal. A widget that greys a button out is a
// courtesy; the guarantee is that the op path itself says no, so a keyboard gesture, a toolbar
// command and a script all meet the same answer. That is why the lock check runs in validation
// and not beside the surface that happens to be mounted.
//
// A VALUE IS TYPED. A dropdown takes an item its own list declares, a combo box takes anything,
// a date takes an ISO date and writes `@w:fullDate` beside the formatted content it paints, and
// a checkbox writes the glyph its own `w14:checkbox` declares. Offering a value of the wrong
// shape is `typeMismatch` rather than a coerced write, because a control that quietly accepted
// the wrong kind of value would produce a document Word reads differently than the caller does.
//
// A BOUND CONTROL IS PRESERVED AND REFUSED. `w:dataBinding` names a custom XML part this engine
// does not resolve; writing the content while the binding still points elsewhere would produce
// a document whose two answers disagree the moment Word opens it.
