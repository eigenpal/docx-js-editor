// Tree-backed document store with intent-scoped semantic history (tasks 5.2, 5.4-5.6).

// One transaction = one atomic publication = one history entry. `apply` stages ops against
// a working part; nothing is visible until `transact` returns, so a rejected op mid-batch
// leaves revision, tree, indexes and subscribers exactly as they were.
//
// HISTORY IS SCOPED BY INTENT, NOT BY A TIMER (design D10). A wall-clock coalescing window
// is the approach D10 rejects: it cannot reliably group an IME composition, whose
// transactions span an unbounded interval, and it just as easily merges across a projection
// reconciliation that should not be an entry at all. Here the caller states the scope — a
// transaction is one entry, a composition is one entry however many transactions it
// contains, and a projection-origin commit is none.
//
// Entries are snapshots, which is affordable because the tree is persistent and
// structurally shared: an entry retains the previous part by reference rather than cloning
// it, so undo is a pointer swap and history costs nothing per entry.
